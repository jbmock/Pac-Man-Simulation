# Pac-Man-Simulation
Description: This project taught me how to control the DOM (Document Object Model) by simulating a Pac-Man character going back and forth on the screen. There are 4 different images implemented to have the Pac-Man open and close its mouth with each move and then also flip to face the opposite direction once window detection is activated and direction of movement is reversed.

How to run: Load the index.html file in your browser and watch Pac-Man come to life!

Future improvements: I will implement more CSS by adding a background color and having the Pac-Man image change color each time window detection is activated.
